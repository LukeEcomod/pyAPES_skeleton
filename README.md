pyAPES_skeleton branch 'mxl' couples pyAPES to convective mixed boundary layer slab model.

\mxl

Simple implementation of Mixed Boundary Layer (MXL) model based on:

mxl_apes.py: couples mxl-model with solution of plant canopy-asl interactions. Currently assumes soil surface state and fluxes = constant & surface layer height = 0.1 x mxl-height

\mxl_canopy

Contains canopy model, simplified planttype-code and 1st order closure models for canopy-surface layer momentum & scalar budgets. 
Leaf energy balance is solved iteratively with solution of scalar profiles throughout the asl.
Note that dict asl_profs give momentum and scalar profiles from ground to asl top but these are not saved in outputs yet. Netcdf-writing needs to be updated.

Todo:

* implement intial states for MXL growth in morning
* what happens when H < 0? Now no collapse of MXL.
* Test mxl-growth against ABL height from ceilometer & soundings when forced by measured surface fluxes.
